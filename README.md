# Selenium-Automation

### Hello there! 
This repo contains work from my College Mini Project based upon automating web browsers with Selenium using Python. Along with it, I also include some <a href='https://github.com/swapnilg4u/selenium-automation/blob/main/SNIPPETS.md'>starter code snippets</a> that'll come handy in case you needed.

### Libraries Used
[![selenium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-Selenium-blue.svg?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) 
Feel free to contribute and/or suggest changes as I won't be able to keep this updated forever.


Give a ‚≠ê if you think this repo is helpful to you.
