# Selenium-Automation

### Hello there! 
This repo contains work from my College Mini Project based upon automating web browsers with Selenium using Python. Along with it, I also include some <a href='https://github.com/swapnilg4u/selenium-automation/blob/main/SNIPPETS.md'>starter code snippets</a> that'll come handy in case you needed.

### Libraries Used
[![selenium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-Selenium-blue.svg?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) 
[Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) - Python Library to perform automated tests in web browser

### How to Run?
Well this is pretty easy you just need to install chromedriver (or driver of your browser) and add it's path to the driver code.
Then install selenium library via `pip install selenium`
And at last run the file `full_running.py` by `python full_running.py`

Also you can check seperate python files for specific codes.

### Contributions
Feel free to contribute and/or suggest changes as I won't be able to keep this updated forever.
