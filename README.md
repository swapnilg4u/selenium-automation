# Selenium-Automation

### Hello there! This repo contains work from my College Mini Project based upon automating web browsers with Selenium using Python. Along with it, I also include some code starter code snippets that'll come handy in case you needed. Feel free to contribute and/or suggest changes as I won't be able to keep this updated forever.
